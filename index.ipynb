Every year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) conducts surveys to understand the latest demographic, health, and fitness trends. You have been tasked with analyzing the recently published results of the 2017-2018 survey and providing your recommendations back to the Chief Analytics Officer and Chief Marketing Officer. You have been assigned the task of taking a first look at the data and beginning to answer several key questions:\n",

        "Now, similar to the previous step, create a plot that shows the distribution of `PHYSHLTH` for those who own vs. rent their homes, including appropriate axis labels and legend. Because there is more of an imbalance of categories this time (more than twice as many owners as renters, compared to nearly-even numbers from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut), make sure you add the argument `density=True`, so that the y-axis shows the density (proportion) rather than the count."
